# Sutra 1.1.38: तद्धितश्चासर्वविभक्तिः

## Overview

**Sanskrit Text**: `तद्धितश्चासर्वविभक्तिः`
**Transliteration**: taddhitaścāsarvavibhaktiḥ
**Translation**: And the words ending in तद्धित or secondary affixes which are not declined in all the cases are also अव्यय or indeclinables.

## Purpose

This `saṃjñā` (definition) sutra further expands the class of `avyaya` (अव्यय), or indeclinable words, in Sanskrit. It states that words formed with `taddhita` (तद्धित, secondary) affixes are classified as `avyaya` if they are `asarvavibhakti` (असर्वविभक्ति), meaning they are not declined in all seven cases. This rule accounts for a significant number of adverbs and other indeclinable words derived from nominal stems, ensuring their invariant form is correctly recognized within the grammatical system.

## Implementation

### Function Signature
```javascript
function applySutra1_1_38(word, context) {
    // Implementation details
}
```

### Key Features
- **`Taddhita` Identification**: The `analyzeTaddhita` function identifies words formed with `taddhita` affixes through pattern matching (e.g., `tas`, `tra`, `dha`) and contextual information.
- **`Asarvavibhakti` Determination**: The `analyzeDeclension` function determines if a word is `asarvavibhakti` (not fully declined), either from explicit context or by recognizing `taddhita` affixes that typically form indeclinable words.
- **`Avyaya` Classification**: The `applySutra1_1_38` function combines these checks to classify such words as `avyaya`.
- **Validation of Invariance**: The `validateTaddhitaAvyaya` function confirms the `avyaya` status and explains its implication for invariance.

### Dependencies
- **Sanskrit Utils**:
  - `SanskritWordLists` from `sanskrit-utils/constants.js` (for `taddhita` patterns and lists of typically indeclinable affixes)

### Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```javascript
import { applySutra1_1_38, analyzeTaddhita, analyzeDeclension, isTypicallyIndeclinable, validateTaddhitaAvyaya, testSutra1_1_38 } from './index.js';

// Example 1: Apply Sutra 1.1.38 to a taddhita word
const context1 = { declension: { type: 'asarvavibhakti' } };
const result1 = applySutra1_1_38('ūrdhvatas', context1);
console.log(result1.applies); // true
console.log(result1.avyaya_status); // true
console.log(result1.taddhita_type); // 'tas'

// Example 2: Analyze taddhita affix presence
const taddhitaAnalysis = analyzeTaddhita('sarvatra');
console.log(taddhitaAnalysis.has_taddhita); // true
console.log(taddhitaAnalysis.affix_type); // 'tra'

// Example 3: Analyze declension status
const declensionAnalysis = analyzeDeclension('pṛṣṭhatas'); // Inferred as asarvavibhakti
console.log(declensionAnalysis.is_fully_declined); // false
console.log(declensionAnalysis.declension_type); // 'asarvavibhakti'

// Example 4: Check if an affix typically forms indeclinables
console.log(isTypicallyIndeclinable('tas')); // true
console.log(isTypicallyIndeclinable('ya')); // false

// Example 5: Validate avyaya status
const validation = validateTaddhitaAvyaya('tridhā');
console.log(validation.is_avyaya); // true
console.log(validation.explanation); // 'Word should remain unchanged...'
```

## Test Coverage

**Test Cases**: The test suite provides comprehensive coverage, including:
- **`applySutra1_1_38`**: Verifies the core logic for classifying `taddhita` words as `avyaya` based on their `asarvavibhakti` status.
- **`analyzeTaddhita`**: Tests the identification of various `taddhita` affixes through patterns and context.
- **`analyzeDeclension`**: Tests the determination of `asarvavibhakti` status, including inference from affix types.
- **`isTypicallyIndeclinable`**: Confirms the correct identification of `taddhita` affix types that typically form indeclinable words.
- **`validateTaddhitaAvyaya`**: Validates the assertion of invariance for `avyaya` words derived from `taddhita` affixes.
- **Edge Cases**: Handles `null`, `undefined`, empty strings, and words without `taddhita` affixes gracefully.

## Technical Details

### Algorithm
1.  **`applySutra1_1_38`**: This function first calls `analyzeTaddhita` to confirm the input `word` has a `taddhita` affix. If it does, it then calls `analyzeDeclension` to check if the word is `asarvavibhakti`. If both conditions are met, the word is classified as `avyaya`.
2.  **`analyzeTaddhita`**: This function checks for explicit `taddhita` information in the `context`. If not present, it attempts to match the `word` against predefined `taddhita` patterns (`SanskritWordLists.taddhitaPatterns`) to identify the affix type.
3.  **`analyzeDeclension`**: This function checks for explicit `declension` information in the `context`. If not present, it infers the `asarvavibhakti` status by checking if the identified `taddhita` affix type is among those that typically form indeclinable words (`SanskritWordLists.typicallyIndeclinableAffixes`).
4.  **`isTypicallyIndeclinable`**: This is a helper function that checks if a given `affix_type` is in the predefined list of `taddhita` affixes that typically form indeclinable words.

### Performance
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) - Operations involve string comparisons and array/regex lookups against fixed-size lists and patterns, resulting in constant time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - Memory usage is minimal and constant, as the lists and patterns are predefined constants.

### Edge Cases
- **Context Dependency**: The rule's application can be influenced by the provided `context` (especially for `declension` information). Without explicit context, the analysis relies on inference from affix types.
- **Ambiguity**: Some `taddhita` affixes can form both declinable and indeclinable words. The `typicallyIndeclinableAffixes` list focuses on those that predominantly form indeclinables.

## Integration

### Related Sutras
- **Sutra 1.1.37 (स्वरादिनिपातमव्ययम्)**: This sutra complements 1.1.37 by adding another major category of words to the `avyaya` class, specifically those derived with `taddhita` affixes that are not fully inflected.
- This rule is crucial for understanding the invariant nature of many adverbs and other indeclinable words in Sanskrit.

### Used By
- Any module in the Panini engine that performs morphological analysis, declension, or sentence parsing will need to consult this sutra to correctly identify `avyaya` words derived from `taddhita` affixes and ensure they are not subjected to inflectional changes.
