/**
 * Sutra 1.1.68: svam rūpaṃ śabdasyāśabdasaṃjñā
 *
 * This sutra is a meta-rule (paribhāṣā) that governs the interpretation of all other rules.
 * It states that a word in a rule refers to its own form, unless it is a technical term.
 *
 * As this is a fundamental principle of interpretation, it does not have a direct
 * functional implementation. Its application is inherent in how the grammar engine
 * processes rules. This file is a placeholder to maintain the project's structure.
