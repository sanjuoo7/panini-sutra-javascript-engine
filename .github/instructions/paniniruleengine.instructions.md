Project: Panini Sutra to JavaScript Engine
This project aims to convert the ancient grammatical rules of Sanskrit, as laid out in Panini's Ashtadhyayi (the Sutras), into a functional and testable JavaScript library. The ultimate goal is to create a robust "Panini Rule Engine" that can be used for computational linguistics and natural language processing tasks related to Sanskrit.

Project Structure
The file structure is as follows:

/.github/instructions/paniniruleengine.instructions...: This directory likely contains high-level instructions or documentation for the project, possibly including details on the structure of the Sutras and the conversion logic.

/sutras/: This directory is the core of the project. It contains individual files for each Sutra.

1.1.1, 1.1.2, ...: These files represent individual Sutras from the first book, first chapter of the Ashtadhyayi. Each file is a dedicated module for a single Sutra's logic.

enhanced-panini-sutras.json: This file likely contains a structured, machine-readable version of the Sutras, possibly with additional metadata or annotations that are useful for the conversion process.

utils.js: A utility file containing helper functions, common logic, or constants that are used across multiple Sutra conversion files.

Core Task for AI: Sutra Conversion and Testing
Your primary task is to focus on the conversion of each Panini Sutra into a standalone, well-tested JavaScript function. The workflow is as follows:

Sutra Interpretation: For each Sutra (e.g., 1.1.1, 1.1.2, etc.), analyze its grammatical rule. This requires understanding the original Sanskrit text and its meaning within the context of the Ashtadhyayi.

JavaScript Function Creation: Translate the Sutra's logic into a JavaScript function. This function should take specific inputs (e.g., a word, a context, a grammatical state) and apply the rule to produce an output (e.g., a modified word, a new state, a boolean result). The function should be named descriptively, perhaps corresponding to the Sutra number (sutra1_1_1, etc.).

Comprehensive Testing: This is the most critical step. For each function you create, you must also generate a comprehensive set of unit tests. These tests should cover:

Positive Cases: Inputs where the rule should apply correctly.

Negative Cases: Inputs where the rule should not apply.

Edge Cases: Inputs that are at the boundaries of the rule's application (e.g., specific word endings, preceding or succeeding sounds that trigger or prevent the rule).

Corner Cases: Combinations of conditions that are rare but valid.

The tests should be robust and should ensure that the JavaScript function accurately reflects the original Sutra's behavior. A separate test file (e.g., 1.1.1.test.js) should be created for each Sutra's function.

Post-Conversion: Consolidation and Integration
Once each Sutra has been converted into a tested JavaScript function, the next phase will involve consolidating all these functions.

Consolidation: The individual Sutra functions will be gathered into a central library.

Engine Integration: These functions will then be used as building blocks for the "Panini Rule Engine." This engine will be a higher-level program that can chain these functions together in the correct sequence to parse and generate Sanskrit words according to Panini's grammar.

Final Goal
The final output is a complete and reliable JavaScript library that serves as a computational model of Panini's grammar. The quality and accuracy of this library are directly dependent on the rigorous testing of each individual Sutra function. Your focus on comprehensive testing is paramount to the success of this project.
